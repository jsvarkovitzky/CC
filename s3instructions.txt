Download s3tools from s3tools.org to your own computer.
See the INSTALL file for general installation instructions.
This will probably work:
  unzip s3cmd-1.1.0-beta3.zip
  cd s3cmd-1.1.0-beta3
  sudo python setup.py install

You might want to alias s3cmd to point to .../s3cmd-1.1.0-beta3/s3cmd
(wherever you put it).

See the README file in s3cmd-1.1.0-beta3 for sample commands to use the
tools, or go to http://s3tools.org/s3cmd

You first have to configure with
  s3cmd --configure
To find your key and secret key, go to the AWS console, click on your name
at the top, and select "Security Credentials" from the dropdown menu.  You
need the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

Then you can just hit <return> for all the other questions until the last
one, type 'y' to save.
